        Martin Luther began his religious life as an Augustinian monk on July
        17, 1505, much to the chagrin of his father, who had hoped for him to
        become a lawyer.  His decision to embrace the monastic life came after
        a dramatic incident in which he was almost struck by lightning on a
        return trip to the University of Erfurt, where he was a student.  In
        fear of death, he cried out to Saint Anna and vowed to become a monk.
        </p>
        <p>
        Luther did not find his life as a monk to be spiritually fulfilling.
        Rather, he struggled with despair that his confessions were not
        sufficient or complete enough:
        <blockquote>
          I lost touch with Christ the Savior and Comforter, and made of him
          the jailer and hangman of my poor soul.
        </blockquote>
        His superior, Johann von Staupitz, urged him to focus more on the
        merits of Christ and on changing his heart rather than on punishment
        and penance.  Luther's struggle and this advice would later inform
        the development of his belief in <em>sola fide</em>, or
        <em>justification by faith alone</em>, which holds that it is only the
        faith in Jesus Christ which we receive through God's grace that
        contributes to our salvation, apart from any good works (such as
        penance) we might do.
        </p>
        <p>
        The founding event of the reformation was Luther's posting of his
        <a href="http://www.luther.de/en/95thesen.html"
           target="_blank">Ninety-five Theses</a> to the door of All Saints'
        Church in Wittenberg.  The Theses addressed what he saw as corruptions
        in the Roman Catholic practice of indulgences, which claimed that
        punishment in Purgatory (for oneself or for another) could be reduced
        or even eliminated through an indulgence acquired through some good
        work.  Often, these indulgences involved going on a pilgrimage or
        praying particular prayers, but some (especially in Luther's day) were
        connected to financial transactions such as donations to the
        reconstruction of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.  Luther questioned the
        efficacy and scriptural basis of this practice, which put him at odds
        with the Roman hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
        After further confrontations with papal theologians regarding his
        doctrine on indulgences and justification by faith, Luther was
        excommunicated by Pope Leo X in 1521.  Shortly after, he was called to
        account for his beliefs to the secular government of the Holy Roman
        Empire at the Diet of Worms (so named because it took place in the town
        of Worms, in modern-day Germany).  Johann Eck, one of Luther's chief
        opponents, challenged him to consider his writings and recant what the
        Roman church viewed as heresy.  Luther refused:
        <blockquote>
          Unless I am convinced by the testimony of the Scriptures or by clear
          reason (for I do not trust either in the pope or in councils alone,
          since it is well known that they have often erred and contradicted
          themselves), I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my
          conscience is captive to the Word of God.  I cannot and will not
          recant anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against
          conscience.  May God help me.  Amen.
        </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
        Luther dedicated the rest of his life to developing his doctrine
        alongside other reformers such as Philip Melanchthon.  His translation
        of the Bible into German allowed the common people to read the
        scriptures in their own language, and his publications and sermons
        formed the early basis of what is now known as Lutheranism.
